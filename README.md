# Energy efficient predictive coding networks

## Description
Supplementary material for 'Predictive coding is a consequence of energy efficiency in recurrent  neural networks'

### Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Pytorch 1.4.0
3. Python  >= 3.7 

### Usage Notes:
- To replicate the results in the paper, please see [paper_results.ipynb](https://github.com/KietzmannLab/EmergentPredictiveCoding/blob/master/paper_results%20.ipynb)  
- To produce the 10 model instances used in determining the preactivations, please run train_models.py:

	```python train_models.py```

If a gpu is available and cuda set up the script will run on the gpu, otherwise it will revert back to cpu. 

### more details will follow soon
