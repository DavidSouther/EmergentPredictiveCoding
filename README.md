# EmergentPredictiveCoding

Code and models accompanying the paper 'Predictive coding is a consequence of energy efficiency in recurrent neural networks .

In work we show that two components of predictive coding, namely error calculation units and prediction units, can emerge in certain conditions without being explicitly modelled.

The networks are trained to minimise the 'preactivation' of the neurons, i.e. the unit state before applying the activation function. The rationale is that this minimises neural activity, while preventing over-inhibition. It is akin to the method of excitatory-inhibitory balance used by [Den√®ve et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.05.016).
